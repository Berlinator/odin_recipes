    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>You've never had a pumpkin spice treat like this before... pumpkin cheesecake meets pleasantly crispy churro! A creamy, sweet, lightly-spiced filling pairs well with a crispy tortilla in this simple, fall-ready dessert enchilada. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree </li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened  </li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar </li>
        <li>1 (3.4 ounce) package instant cheesecake-flavored pudding mix </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
        <li>12 (6 inch) flour tortillas </li>
        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted </li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container whipped topping, thawed </li>
        <li>⅓ cup caramel sauce </li>
        <li>¼ cup cinnamon graham cracker crumbs </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a sieve with paper towels and place over a bowl. Place pumpkin puree on the paper towels and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator and allow to drain for 2 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until very smooth. Add 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, pudding mix, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix until well blended. Mix in drained pumpkin. Divide mixture among tortillas and roll them up. </li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Brush each stuffed tortilla with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place as many enchiladas in the preheated air fryer as will fit in a single layer with at least 1/4 of an inch in between. Air-fry until golden brown and lightly crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a serving tray and let cool. Repeat to air-fry remaining enchiladas.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, top evenly with whipped topping, caramel sauce, and graham cracker crumbs.</li>
    </ol>
